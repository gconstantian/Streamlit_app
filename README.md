# Streamlit_app
This is the streamlit app I am making for Professor Reuther for the SABER conference

Below are some other streamlit apps that have interesting functions to them. I will link each one and then explain how it might be useful for this project


https://weaviate-magic-chat.streamlit.app/
this app includes a chat functions that also returns accurate pictures and information based on what is given in an attached Weaviate detector. I think this would be extremely helpful to use since so much of biology is visual learning. This provides more accurate information to the student and gives the teacher more control of the content.

https://molecule-icon-generator.streamlit.app/
this app is a molecule generator and is overall just really cool. Helpful within biochemical classes. The current model is great for introductory biology classes, but kind of hits a brick wall once you start moving into more complex subjects.

I am just linking this app because I like the side bar pages and want to include it and not forget it.
